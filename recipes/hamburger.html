        <h3>Awesome Pasta Salad</h3>
        <ul class="list ul">
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li> 1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>5 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Let's continue with details how to cook step-by-step.</h3>
        <ol class="list ol">
            <li><strong>Step: </strong>Combine the milk, 1 cup of water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil then remove from the heat and let stand until lukewarm. If the mixture is too hot, it will kill the yeast.</li>
            <li><strong>Step: </strong>In a large bowl, stir together the flour and yeast. Pour in wet ingredients and stir until the dough starts to pull together. If you have a stand mixer, use the dough hook to mix for about 8 minutes. If not, knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover and let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Step: </strong>Punch down the dough and divide into 12 portions They should be a little larger than a golf ball. Make tight balls out of the dough by pulling the dough tightly around and pinching it at the bottom. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. After the rolls sit for a minute and relax, flatten each ball with the palm of your hand until it is 3 to 4 inches wide. You may want to oil your hand first. Set rolls aside until they double in size, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step: </strong>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix together the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of water in a cup or small bowl. Brush onto the tops of the rolls. Position 2 oven racks so they are not too close to the top or bottom of the oven.</li>
            <li><strong>Step: </strong>Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the rolls from the oven and return them to different shelves so each one spends a little time on the top. Continue to bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until nicely browned on the top and bottom.</li>
